# Movie-Recommender-System-With-The-Movies-Dataset-Kaggle

The Following code repository consists of the code file for the Movie Recommender System.

Summary of the Project - 

1. Dataset : the-movies-dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) it constitutes of metadata of 45,000 movies.

Note:

Hello folks, 

I am soon going to add the Collaborative Filtering Based Recommender System's code also in to this repository.

Till then stay tuned.
